Description:
    Generates a Matestack Layout under app/matestack with
    the specified class namespace and directory structure provided in NAME.

    e.g.
    - NAME set to "demo", sets the Layouts's class name to Demo.
    - NAME set to "admin/pages/orders/index" sets the Layout's class name
      to Admin::Pages::Orders::Index

    By default the Layout class will inherit from ApplicationLayout (the
    recommended base class to inherit your Matestack::Ui::Layout(s) from in
    order to share the Component Registry throughout your application) if it
    exists under app/matestack/application_layout.rb. This is the path where
    the Matestack generator `bin/rails generate matestack:registry --core` would
    create the ApplicationLayout class in.

    To inherit directly from Matestack::Ui::Layout instead, invoke the
    generator with --no-base.

    You may optionally invoke the generator with the --full flag in order to
    build a page with a #prepare, and a dummy partial.

Example:
    bin/rails generate matestack:layout demo/layout

    This will create:
        app/matestack/demo/layout.rb

    bin/rails generate matestack:layout admin/pages/products/layout

    This will create:
        app/matestack/admin/pages/products/layout.rb
