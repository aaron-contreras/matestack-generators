Description:
    Generates a Matestack Component under app/matestack/components with
    the specified namespace and directory structure provided in NAME.

    By default the component will be added to the default component registry if
    it exists under app/matestack/components/registry.rb.

    If you don't wish to add this component to the registry, invoke the generator
    with --no-registry.

    By default the component class will inherit from ApplicationComponent, the
    suggested base class to inherit from in order to share the component registry
    throughout your application.

    To inherit directly from Matestack::Ui::Component instead, invoke the
    generator with --no-application-component.

Example:
    bin/rails generate matestack:component card

    This will create:
        app/matestack/components/card.rb

    bin/rails generate matestack:component admin/dashboard/card

    This will create:
        app/matestack/components/admin/dashboard/card.rb
