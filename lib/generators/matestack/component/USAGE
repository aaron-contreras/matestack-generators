Description:
    Generates a Matestack Component under app/matestack/components with
    the specified namespace and directory structure provided in NAME.

    By default the component will be added to the Component Registry if
    it exists under app/matestack/components/registry.rb. This is the path
    where the Matestack generator `bin/rails generate matestack:registry`
    would create the registry module in.

    If you don't wish to add this component to the registry, invoke the generator
    with --no-registry.

    By default the component class will inherit from ApplicationComponent (the
    recommended base class to inherit your Matestack::Ui::Component(s) from in
    order to share the Component Registry throughout your application) if it
    exists under app/matestack/application_component.rb. This is the path where
    the Matestack generator `bin/rails generate matestack:registry --core` would
    create the ApplicationComponent class in.

    To inherit directly from Matestack::Ui::Component instead, invoke the
    generator with --no-base.

Example:
    bin/rails generate matestack:component card

    This will create:
        app/matestack/components/card.rb
    And if the registry exists, modify:
        app/matestack/components/registry.rb

    bin/rails generate matestack:component admin/dashboard/card

    This will create:
        app/matestack/components/admin/dashboard/card.rb
    And if the registry exists, modify:
        app/matestack/components/registry.rb
