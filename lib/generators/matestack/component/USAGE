Description:
    Generates a Matestack Component under app/matestack/components with
    the specified namespace and directory structure provided in NAME.

    e.g.
    - NAME set to "demo", sets the Component's class name to Components::Demo.
    - NAME set to "admin/pages/orders/index" sets the Page's class name
      to Componenets::Admin::Pages::Orders::Index

    By default the component will be added to the Component Registry if
    it exists under app/matestack/components/registry.rb. This is the path
    where the Matestack generator `bin/rails generate matestack:registry`
    would create the registry module in.

    If you don't wish to add your component to the registry, invoke the generator
    with --no-registry.

    By default the component class will inherit from ApplicationComponent (the
    recommended base class to inherit your Matestack::Ui::Component(s) from in
    order to share the Component Registry throughout your application) if it
    exists under app/matestack/application_component.rb. This is the path where
    the Matestack generator `bin/rails generate matestack:registry --core` would
    create the ApplicationComponent class in.

    To inherit directly from Matestack::Ui::Component instead, invoke the
    generator with --no-base.

    You may optionally invoke the generator with the --full flag in order to
    build a component with a #render?, #prepare, sample required/optional
    injectable property declarations and a dummy partial.

Example:
    bin/rails generate matestack:component card

    This will create:
        app/matestack/components/card.rb
    And if the registry exists, modify:
        app/matestack/components/registry.rb


    bin/rails generate matestack:component admin/dashboard/card

    This will create:
        app/matestack/components/admin/dashboard/card.rb
    And if the registry exists, modify:
        app/matestack/components/registry.rb


    bin/rails generate matestack:component admin/dashboard/card --no-registry
    
    This will create:
        app/matestack/components/admin/dashboard/card.rb
