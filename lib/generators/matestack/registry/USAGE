Description:
    Generates a Matestack component registry module that can be included in
    your other Ruby files throughout your app.
    
    Optionally (and recommended), using the --with-base-classes flag you're
    able to generate a set of base classes in order to share the registry among
    your Matestack Layouts, Pages and Components by inheriting from these base classes.

Example:
    bin/rails generate matestack:registry

    This will create:
        app/matestack/components/registry.rb

Example:
    bin/rails generate matestack:registry --with-base-classes

    This will create:
        app/matestack/components/registry.rb
        app/matestack/application_layout.rb
        app/matestack/application_page.rb
        app/matestack/application_component.rb
        app/matestack/application_vue_js_component.rb
