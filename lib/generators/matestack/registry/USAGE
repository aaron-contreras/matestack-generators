Description:
    Generates a Matestack component registry and a set of base classes
    in order to share the registered components among your Matestack
    Layouts, Pages and Components. You can also bundle shared setup/methods
    in these.

Example:
    bin/rails generate matestack:base_classes

    This will create:
        app/matestack/components/registry.rb
        app/matestack/application_layout.rb
        app/matestack/application_page.rb
        app/matestack/application_component.rb
        app/matestack/application_vue_js_component.rb
